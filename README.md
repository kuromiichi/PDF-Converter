# PDF Converter (Python)

This Python script accepts a directory containing images as input and converts all images into a single .pdf file.

To create the PDF, simply create a folder and put all the images to be converted in it. Then introduce the path to the folder in the script and choose a name for the PDF file. The PDF file will be created in the same folder.

Make sure that the only files in the folder are the images you want to convert before running the script, otherwise it may not work properly.


Note: this script was written just for fun and training purposes, I wasn't too rigurous about possible errors.
